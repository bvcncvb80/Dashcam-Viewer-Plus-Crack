What’s NEW:

- Added a “Cancel” button to the Video Load progress bar. Clicking the button will abort importation of a large set of video files. The video files that have been loaded up to that point will still be processed and displayed.

  Features of Dashcam Viewer Plus:
  
- Map Displays
Your vehicle’s entire route and current position are displayed in an animated 2D map. The route line is color-coded based on the vehicle’s speed. Click anywhere along the route to jump to that point in the video sequence. Choose between different map providers (Google, MapQuest) and themes (satellite, road, hybrid). Highlight important points in the route with Geotag markers.

- Geotags
Geotags are custom markers you can drop at any point along your trip. They appear on the map and in the Geotags list view. Metadata such as the time, date, speed, latitude, longitude, street address, movie name, and movie time are stored with each geotag. Double-click a geotag in the Geotags List and you will jump instantly to that point in the video sequence. Geotags can be exported and imported for easy access.

- Export GPS Data
Dashcam Viewer’s Data Browser allows you to preview and export your GPS data in multiple formats, including comma-separated value (CSV), GPX, Google Earth KML, and GeoJSON. Portions of videos can be exported to short clips, with or without sound, at accelerated or decelerated playback rates. Still, frames from videos can be exported to JPG, PNG, or BMP images individually or at a specific frequency.

- Data Plots
Dashcam Viewer’s Plot Views show a time history of your vehicle’s speed, distance, and compass direction. For dashcams that record additional GPS data, the G-sensor (shock), vehicle altitude, number of GPS satellites in view, and horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) are also displayed.

- Audio Event Detection
Important events in the video series are often characterized by sudden changes in volume. For example, the sound of a collision or the sound of a horn can be heard against the normal driving noise background. Dashcam Viewer’s Audio Event Detection can assist in locating key sound events in a series of videos.

- Videos List
Loaded videos are shown in the Videos list. Uninteresting videos can be toggled off so they no longer appear in the video sequence and their GPS data is removed. To play a specific video simply double-click on it in the list. Additional information about each video is displayed alongside its filename, including file size, maximum vehicle speed, date, and time, which is displayed in the list item.

- Trip List
Dashcam Viewer bins videos automatically into trips. A trip is categorized as one or more contiguous videos that have no break between them greater than one minute. Dashcam Viewer then computes statistics for each trip. This includes the start date and time, duration of the trip, amount of time between trips, and the number of videos per trip.

- Export & Merge Video
You can export whole videos or parts of videos into short clips or a series of images. Video clips can be exported with or without sound and at an accelerated or decelerated playback rate. Still, frames can be exported to JPG, PNG, or BMP images individually or at a specific frequency. You also have the ability to merge multiple videos into a single large file. When merging, Dashcam Viewer will create a GPX file with the GPS data from the selected videos so that you can import that data back into Dashcam Viewer if needed.

- Dashboard Display
Dashcam Viewer’s dashboard display shows your vehicle’s current metrics including position, speed, and compass heading. Speed can be shown in mph or km/h. The dashboard also shows the weather conditions at the time and location of the drive. For dashcams that support enhanced GPS data collection, Dashcam Viewer displays the altitude, number of satellites in view, and signal confidence. Choose from one of the 19 compass pointer icons in the Pro version.
